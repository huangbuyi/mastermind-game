**Mastermind Game Introduction**

Mastermind is a classic code-breaking logic game that challenges players to use their deductive reasoning skills. The game is typically played between two people: one person acts as the "codemaker," who sets up a secret code, and the other person is the "codebreaker," whose goal is to decipher the code.

### Game Setup:
- The codemaker selects a secret sequence of colored pegs or holes. The standard version usually consists of four colored pegs chosen from a set of six different colors.
- The codebreaker attempts to guess the secret code by placing a row of colored pegs on the board.

### Gameplay:
1. **Setting the Code**: The codemaker secretly arranges the pegs according to the predetermined sequence.
2. **Guessing**: The codebreaker places their first guess—a row of four colored pegs—on the board.
3. **Feedback**: After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback using black and white pegs:
   - **Black Pegs**: Indicate that a peg is the correct color in the correct position.
   - **White Pegs**: Indicate that a peg is the correct color but in the wrong position.
   - The feedback does not specify which pegs correspond to the black or white pegs; it only indicates the number of correct colors and positions.

4. **Adjusting Guesses**: Based on the feedback, the codebreaker adjusts subsequent guesses until the secret code is correctly identified or until the maximum number of guesses (usually 10) is reached.

### Winning Conditions:
- The codebreaker wins if they correctly identify the secret code within the given number of tries.
- The codemaker wins if the codebreaker fails to crack the code within the specified number of attempts.

### Variations:
- Some versions allow for repeated colors in the secret code, increasing the complexity of the game.
- There are also three-dimensional variations and other adaptations that add layers of difficulty.

Mastermind is a versatile game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages and is excellent for developing logical thinking and problem-solving skills.
